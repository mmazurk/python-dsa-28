# I originally wanted to generate dynamic names for the nodes, but this is not ever recommended
# Instead, just put them into a dictionaries or lists
# That makes it easy to iterate through and set the self.next values

# I also didn't understand that the __repr__ function will recursively run on {self.next}
# So you end up getting 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 when you print the first node
# I didn't realize that by returning just the first node from my list, the other nodes were still alive in memory
# because they are assigned in a chain from the first node to the last
# Lastly, my brain just doesn't understand the order of operations for reversing a linked list
# The order is this:
# start by establishing what is your previous_node and current_node when you are at head
# then in the while loop
# (1) create a variable to remember the next node, (2) set current.next to previous, (3) update previous to current
# and (4) move to the next node
# It seems so simple yet I am absolutely confounded when I try to do it
