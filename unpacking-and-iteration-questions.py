# Expected Output:
# Alice: 85
# Bob: 92
# Charlie: 78

# Given list of lists
nested_lists = [["apple", "red", 1.2], [
    "banana", "yellow", 0.5], ["cherry", "red", 0.2]]

# Loop to unpack and print each sublist's elements

# Expected Output:
# The apple is red and weighs 1.2kg
# The banana is yellow and weighs 0.5kg
# The cherry is red and weighs 0.2kg

# Given list of strings
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Loop to print each string with its index

# Expected Output:
# 0: apple
# 1: banana
# 2: cherry

# Given lists

# Loop to iterate over both lists and print each name with its corresponding age

# Expected Output:
# Alice is 25 years old
# Bob is 30 years old
# Charlie is 35 years old

# Given list of dictionaries
people = [{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}, {
    "name": "Bob", "age": 30}, {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}]

# Loop to iterate and unpack each dictionary

# Expected Output:
# Alice is 25 years old
# Bob is 30 years old
# Charlie is 35 years old

# Loop to iterate over a range with steps

# Expected Output:
# 0
# 5
# 10
# 15
# 20

# Given list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# List to hold squared numbers

# Loop to square each number and add to the new list

# Expected Output:
# Squared numbers: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Given list of tuples
